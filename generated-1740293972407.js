To recreate the given image of a house with a tree using React, we will break down the image into SVG components and use JSX for the structure. Here's how you can create a functional React component using hooks and JSX to draw this shape using SVG:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const HouseWithTree = () => {
  return (
    <svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
      {/* Tree Trunk */}
      <rect x="30" y="100" width="20" height="50" fill="brown" />
      
      {/* Tree foliage */}
      <circle cx="40" cy="85" r="25" fill="green" />
      
      {/* Roof */}
      <polygon points="100,30 70,70 130,70" fill="gray" />
      
      {/* House Body */}
      <rect x="70" y="70" width="60" height="50" fill="blue" />
      
      {/* House Door */}
      <rect x="95" y="90" width="20" height="30" fill="saddlebrown" />
    </svg>
  );
};

export default HouseWithTree;
```

### Explanation:
- **SVG Container**: The SVG container is set with a width and height of 200 to provide enough space for the whole drawing.
- **Tree Trunk**: A rectangle (`<rect>`) is used for the tree trunk with `x` and `y` coordinates to position it properly.
- **Tree Foliage**: A circle (`<circle>`) is used for the tree foliage, positioned above the trunk.
- **Roof**: A polygon (`<polygon>`) is used to create the triangular roof shape of the house.
- **House Body**: Another rectangle represents the house's main body.
- **House Door**: A smaller rectangle represents the door on the house body.

You can tweak the `fill` properties of each shape to adjust colors according to your preference or design specifications.
